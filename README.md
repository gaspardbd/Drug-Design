# Drug Design

Welcome to the `Drug_Design` repository! This collection of Jupyter notebooks is designed to facilitate hands-on experience with cutting-edge techniques in the field of drug discovery using AI. These resources are for some of them freely available and are particularly suited for use on Google Colab to leverage GPU access for computational tasks. We completed, modified some of them to suit to our work and to go further in the analysis. 

## Notebooks

### Diffdock on BCR-ABL Complex
-  This notebook demonstrates the application of Diffdock to simulate docking processes between ligands and the BCR-ABL protein complex. We adapted to our studied case a freely available notebook that allow users to run diffdock on Colab. Users can execute the entire docking procedure, analyze the results, and visualize interactions within the complex. The initial notebook can be found on https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CTtUGg05-2MtlWmfJhqzLTtkDDaxCDOQ . 

### Comparative Study of Diffdock and GNINA
-  This notebook explore comparative analyses between Diffdock and GNINA on a specified protein. This notebook focuses on evaluating the results based on RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) metrics to assess the accuracy of predictions made by each model.

### Understanding SDE with Valentin de Bortoli's Work
- Inspired by Valentin de Bortoliâ€™s research, his notebook simplifies the concepts of scoring models and the stochastic differential equation (SDE) process. It includes a straightforward 2D example to illustrate the forward and backward processes in an accessible manner.

### Diffusion Models on Fashion MNIST
- This notebook from the CNRS investigate the capabilities of diffusion models through a practical example using the Fashion MNIST dataset. This notebook helps users understand the underlying principles of diffusion models and showcases their application in generating diverse fashion item images.
